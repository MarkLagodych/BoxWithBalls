# Box with balls

A simple program in processing that makes balls to move, collide with the box (actually, the window border) and (optionally) simulate friction.

## Features:

* When a mouse button is pressed, balls scatter from the cursor.
* Friction is toggled on every key press.
* The bigger is a ball, the more friction it has.
